Below is taken from the Rancher Training Vid
Always put the specific version number in to avoid problems.
```

## Migrating Mysql server is being a PITA.
* having problem with new ut8mb4
* tried mysqldump --compatible=ansi did not work with
* DO not use the mysql database - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7002100/default-mysql-database-name 
    ```
    There is no default database.
    A fresh MySQL server install will have 0 databases. The install script will run mysql_install_db after the server is running to create a mysql database, which MySQL uses to store users and privileges. Don't put your data there.
    You can create your own databases by issuing CREATE DATABASE [name] queries if your user has permission.```
    ```

- Do not launch pods
- Do not launch replica sets
- Launch Deployments
  - create and update ReplicaSets
  - allows you to easily scale perform rolling upgrades
  - always build aplications that are stateless
    - statefull application needs to know who it is and who its friends are.
    - Mysql databases require stateful set
    - daemon set launches 1 pod on each node.
    - Job controller: starts, does something then exits, example backups
    - CronJobs: start jobs at a given intervel.
  - Never run containers with the tag latest. always specify the version. - Use specific tags.
  - Rancher deployments can rollback infinetly. Kubernetes limits you to one rollback.
  - external-dns package for kubernetes
  
  * A few notes on persistent storage: NFS mount
